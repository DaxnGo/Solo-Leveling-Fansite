        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          The story follows Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest Hunter ranked as an
          E-rank. Despite his lack of strength, he continues working as a Hunter
          to support his sick mother and younger sister. During a dangerous
          dungeon raid, Jin-Woo and his party are trapped in a dungeon with a
          hidden "Double Dungeon."
        </p>
        <p>
          This new area contains a deadly trial where almost everyone in the
          group is killed. Jin-Woo sacrifices himself to save his teammates, but
          instead of dying, he awakens in a hospital with a mysterious ability:
          a "System" that allows him to level up and grow stronger, like a
          character in a video game.
